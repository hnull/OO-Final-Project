In this project we have "Expression" as a Top class. He has got two child's class "Operators" and "Operands" which both of them are abstract and their children should implement their methods.(In this Project especially we need to calculate value and derivation).

Operands divide into two groups: 1) Binary operands like sum, power, multiply and ... 2) Unary operands like sqrt, logarithm and ... .

Operators consist of values and trigonometric functions like sinus, cotangent and ..., as one of the important functions we can have in mathematics.

We calculate value and derivation of expressions with top down approach until we reach to a value or a function that we know their formulas.

Sample test are provided in "Tests" directory, using Junit library. Also we can have manual test in "Main" class  under the "src" directory.
